```
git add .
```

Commit:
```
git commit -m "<your commit message>"
```

Push up changes and submit pull request in GitHub:

```

Inside of GitHub repo, click on pull request. Send the link of the pull request to the group slack channel, and ask for 👀. If there are no merge conflicts, then click merge button. If there **are** conflicts, please keep reading. 

To resolve the conflicts, from your feature branch, fetch and merge origin master:
```
